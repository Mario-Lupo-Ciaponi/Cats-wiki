                    <h2>Why do cats purr?</h2>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Purring</strong> is usually associated with some kind of <span>enjoyable activity</span>, 
                        <span>such as nursing, being pet, grooming a fellow cat</span>,
                        or <span>just being in a comfortable environment</span>, but <strong>cats</strong> 
                        also <strong>purr</strong> when they're <span>sick, injured,</span> or <span>stressed</span>. 
                        This could serve to <span>soothe</span> them, but 
                        researchers have found that <strong>purring</strong> actually <span>helps</span> them <span>heal</span>
                        because of the <span>low frequency</span> of the <span>vibrations</span>. 
                        Some <span>behaviorists</span> believe that <strong>purring</strong> serves as a <span>method of communication </span> 
                        too, such as from a <strong>kitten</strong> to its <span>mother</span>  or when they're <span>hungry</span> 
                        (which is often combined with a <span>meow</span>).

                    <img src="images/cat_kneading.jpg" alt="cat kneading">

                    <p>
                        <strong>Kneading</strong> serves a number of purposes during all stages of a <strong>cat's</strong> life. 
                        As <strong>kittens</strong>,<strong>kneading</strong> the mammary glands of their mother 
                        stimulates <span>milk production</span> during <span>nursing</span>.
                        Later in life, <strong>kneading</strong> can also be used to <span>mark territory</span> by allowing the release of pheromones that 
                        are stored inside <span>special scent glands located in the paw</span>. <strong>Kneading</strong> can also be used to break down 
                        bedding and create a <span>warm and comfortable environment for sleeping</span>.

                    <img src="images/cat-sleeping.jpg" alt="sleeping cat">

                    <p>
                        <strong>Cats sleep</strong> up to <span>16 hours per day</span> in short increments that alternate between <span>dozing</span>  
                        and <span>deep sleep</span>. Some <strong>cats</strong>, especially <span>seniors</span>,
                        can <strong>sleep</strong> up to <span>20 hours per day</span>! One reason they <strong>sleep</strong> so much is because
                        they are <span>predators</span> that use a lot of <span>energy</span> in small <span>bursts</span> when they <span>hunt</span>. 
                        They're also <span>crepuscular</span>, which means they are <span>most active</span> at dawn and dusk so you're more 
                        likely to see them <span>sleeping throughout the day</span>.

                    <p>
                        <strong>The average lifespan</strong> of an indoor <strong>cat</strong> is <span>13 to 17 years</span>. 
                        With yearly <span>veterinary exams</span> and <span>routine care</span>, our <strong>feline friends</strong>
                        are living <span>longer</span> than ever. 
                        In fact, the percentage of <strong>domestic cats</strong> 6 years old and above has doubled over the last <span>25 years</span>. 
                        This coincides with a growing appreciation for <strong>cats</strong> as a whole as well as 
                        <span>owners</span>  becoming aware of their unique <span>physiology</span> 
                        and set of <span>behavioral needs</span>.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Whiskers</strong> are a <span>highly sensitive organ</span>, which <span>helps inform</span> <strong>cats</strong>  
                        <span>about surrounding objects, air movements and more</span>. Their length helps a <strong>cat</strong> 
                        to gauge its <span>ability to navigate</span> a
                        tight space and they can be <span>raised or lowered</span>  as a means of <span>communication</span> or during 
                        stressful events. Because of their <span>vital importance</span>, <span class="very-important">never</span>

                        <strong>Catnip</strong> is <span>perennial herb</span> and <span>member of the mint family</span>. 
                        Its active <span>ingredient</span> nepetalactone is found

                    <h2>Why do cats hate water?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Many <strong>cats</strong> dislike <strong>water</strong> for 
                        a couple of reasons. First, most <strong>cats</strong> have 
                        <span>very limited experiences</span> with <strong>water</strong>, and they're often negative (i.e. a bath). 
                        In fact, since they evolved in <span>desert climates</span>, they've <span>never been very familiar</span>  
                        with <strong>water</strong>. Their <span>fur</span> also isn't designed to repel <strong>water</strong> so it becomes 
                        <span>uncomfortable</span> if it gets <span>too wet</span>. Not all <strong>cats</strong> hate <strong>water</strong>, though. 
                        There are certain <a href="cats-breeds.html">breeds</a> of <strong>cats</strong> that <span>love water</span>, such as <span>Abyssinians,
                        Turkish Vans, Bengals, and Maine Coons</span>.

                    <img src="images/cat-eats-grass.jpg" alt="cat eating grass">

                    <p>
                        Most <span>veterinarians</span> think <strong>cats</strong> like to eat <strong>grass</strong> to relieve gastrointestinal 
                        issues or to get rid of <span>parasites</span> since <strong>grass</strong> has a lot of <span>fiber</span>. It also 
                        provides <span>nutrients</span> (i.e. folic acid). Other <strong>cats</strong>, however, may just like the 
                        <span>taste</span> of it. Just make sure your <strong>cat</strong> isn't eating any <span>toxic plants or grass 
                        that was treated with chemicals</span>, and if you notice they're <span>eating</span> large amounts 
                        of grass, talk to your <span>vet</span> because there could be an <span>underlying problem</span>.

                        safety as needed</span>. <strong>Cats</strong> enjoy all kinds of enclosures and <span>feel safe</span> and <span>comfortable</span>  
                        in a <strong>box, backpack</strong>  or other type of <strong>bag</strong>.
