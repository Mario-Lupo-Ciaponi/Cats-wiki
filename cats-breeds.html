                     <strong>The Siamese cat</strong> is one of the first distinctly recognized breeds of Asian cat.
                     Derived from the Wichianmat landrace, one of several varieties of cat native to Thailand,
                     the original Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century.

                        <strong>The Persian cat</strong>, also known as <strong>the Persian longhair</strong>, is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by a round face and short muzzle.
                        The first documented ancestors of <strong>Persian cats</strong> were imported into Italy from Persia around 1620. Widely recognized by cat fancy since
                        the late 19th century, <strong>Persian cats</strong>  were first adopted by the British, and later by American breeders after World War II. Some cat
                        fancier organizations' breed standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair as variants of this breed, while others generally
                        treat them as separate breeds.

                        <strong>The Maine Coon</strong> is a large domesticated cat breed. It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America.
                        The breed originated in the U.S. state of Maine, where it is the official state cat.
                        The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened 
                        when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century. <strong>The Maine Coon</strong> has 
                        since made a comeback and is now the third most popular pedigreed cat breed in the world.

                        <strong>The Ragdoll</strong> is a breed of cat with a distinct colorpoint coat and blue eyes. Its morphology is large and weighty,
                        and it has a semi-long and silky soft coat. American breeder Ann Baker developed <strong>Ragdolls</strong> in the 1960s.
                        They are best known for their docile, placid temperament and affectionate nature.
                        The name <strong>'Ragdoll'</strong> is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed 
                        when picked up. The breed is particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

                        <strong>The Abyssinian</strong> is a breed of domestic short-haired cat with a distinctive "ticked" 
                        tabby coat, in which individual hairs are banded with different colors. They are also known simply as <strong>Abys</strong>. 
                        The source of the name is not because Ethiopia, formerly Abyssinia, is thought to be the original home of these cats,
                        but because the first "Abyssinians" exhibited in shows in England were reported to have been imported to England from there.
                        Its true origin — according to genetic studies — is likely to have been the coast of the Indian Ocean in parts of 
                        Southeast Asia, and its introduction to Abyssinia (and others) was through colonialists and merchants stopping through Calcutta.

                        <strong>The Oriental Shorthair</strong> is a breed of <strong>domestic cat</strong> that is developed from and closely
                        related to the <strong>Siamese cat</strong> . It maintains the modern Siamese head and body type but 
                        appears in a wide range of coat colors and patterns. Like the Siamese, Orientals have almond-shaped eyes, 
                        a triangular head shape, large ears, and an elongated, slender, and muscular body. Their personalities 
                        are also very similar. Orientals are social, intelligent, and many are rather vocal. They often remain 
                        playful into adulthood, with many enjoying playing fetch. Despite their slender appearance, they are 
                        athletic and can leap into high places. They prefer to live in pairs or groups and also seek human 
                        interaction.

                        <strong>The Himalayan</strong>, is a breed or sub-breed of long-haired cat similar in type to the Persian,
                        with the exception of its blue eyes and its point colouration, which were derived from crossing 
                        <strong>the Persian</strong>  with <strong>the Siamese</strong> . Some registries may classify the Himalayan as a long-haired sub-breed 
                        of Siamese, or a colorpoint sub-breed of Persian. The World Cat Federation has merged them with the 
                        Colorpoint Shorthair and Javanese into a single breed, the Colorpoint.

                        <strong>The American Shorthair</strong>  is a breed of <strong>domestic cat</strong>  believed to be descended from European cats brought to 
                        North America by early settlers to protect valuable cargo from mice and rats. According to the Cat Fanciers'
                        Association, in 2020, it was the eighth most popular pedigreed cat in the world.
