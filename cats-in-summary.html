               <p>
                Just like the other other felid species it shares a similarity in its <strong>anatomy</strong>:
                it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable
                claws adapted to killing small prey and keep an active life of hunting.
                Its <strong>night vision</strong> and sense of smell are well developed. <strong>Cat communication</strong>
                includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and
                grunting as well as cat-specific <strong>body language</strong>. The cat is a social species, 
                but it is a solitary hunter.

                <h3>Cat's pregnancy</h3>

               <p>
                <strong>The female cat</strong> can have <strong>kittens</strong>, <strong>cat pregnancy</strong> normally lasts between 63 to 67 days,
                but it can be hard to know exactly how long a <strong>cat</strong> is <span>pregnant</span> for. You can't tell if your 
                <strong>cat is pregnent</strong>, because it won't show any <span>symptoms</span> until it 
                is a <span>few weeks</span>  from give <span>birth</span>.
                <strong>Cats</strong> can have an average of four to six kittens per litter
