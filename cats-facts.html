                        A <strong>house cat's</strong> genome is <span>95.6</span> percent tiger, and they share many behaviors with their jungle 
                        ancestors, says 
                        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Layla-Morgan-Wilde/author/B076D6B919?ref=ap_rdr&store_ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true">Layla Morgan Wilde</a>,
                        a <span>cat behavior expert</span>  and the founder of <span>Cat Wisdom 101</span>.
                        These <span>behaviors</span> include scent marking by <span>scratching, prey play, prey stalking,
                        pouncing, chinning, and urine marking</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cats</strong> are believed to be the only <strong>mammals</strong> who don't taste <span>sweetness</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cats</strong> can jump up to <span>six times</span> their length.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cats</strong> have <span>230 bones</span> , while humans only have <span>206</span>.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cats</strong> have an <span>extra organ</span> that allows them to taste scents on the air,
                        which is why your <strong>cat</strong> stares at you with her <span>mouth open</span> from time to time
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cats</strong> have <span>whiskers</span> on the backs of their front legs, as well.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cats</strong> have nearly twice the amount of <span>neurons</span> in their <span>cerebral 
                        cortex</span> as <span>dogs</span>.

                    <li><strong>Cats</strong> use their <span>long tails</span> to balance themselves when they're <span>jumping</span> 
                        or <span>walking</span> along <span>narrow ledges</span>.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Cats</strong> use their <span>whiskers</span>  to <span>“feel”</span> the world around them in 
                        an effort to determine which <span>small spaces</span> they can fit into. 
                        A <strong>cat's whiskers</strong> are generally about the same <span>width</span>  as its <span>body</span>. 
                        <span>(This is why you should never, <span class="very-important">EVER</span> cut their whiskers.)</span>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Cats</strong> walk like <span>camels</span> and <span>giraffes</span>:
                        They move both of their right feet first, then move both of their left feet. No other <span>animals</span> walk this way
                    </li>
                    <li>Some <strong>cats</strong> can <span>swim</span>.</li>
                    <li>
                        A <strong>cat's</strong> average <span>lifespan</span> increased by <span>a year</span> over the span of time 
                       <span>between 2002 and 2012</span>, according to a study <span>by Banfield Pet Hospital</span>.

                    <li>
                        According to <span>The Huffington Post</span>, <strong>cats</strong> typically sleep for <span>12</span> to <span>16</span>
                        hours <span>a day</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cats'</strong> purring may be <span>a self-soothing behavior</span>, since they make this noise when they're
                        <span>ill</span> or <span>distressed</span>, as well as when they're <span>happy</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cats</strong> live longer when they stay <span>indoors</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cats</strong> will refuse an <span>unpalatable food</span> to the point of <span>starvation</span>.</li>

                    <li>Despite <span>popular belief</span>, many <strong>cats</strong> are actually <span>lactose intolerant</span>.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Female cats</strong> have <span>the ability</span> to <span>get pregnant</span> when they are only 
                        <span>4 months old</span>!

                        <span>Grapes and raisins, as well as onions, garlic, and chives</span>, are all <span>extremely harmful foods</span> 
                        for <strong>cats</strong>. <span>Grapes and raisins</span> can cause <span>kidney failure</span> — 
                        although the reasoning behind that isnt clear. 
                        Meanwhile, <span>onions, garlic, and chives wreak havoc</span> on your <strong>cats</strong> <span>gastrointestinal system</span> 
                        and can cause <span>anemia</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Male cats</strong> who have been <span>fixed</span> need <span>fewer calories</span> to maintain 
                        their <span>weight</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>A cat</strong> with <span>a question-mark-shaped tail</span> is asking, <span>“Want to play?”</span></li>
                    <li>
                        According to <span>Wilde</span>, a slow blink is a <span>“kitty kiss”</span>. This <span>movement</span> 
                        shows <span>contentment and trust</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cats</strong> have a unique <span>“vocabulary”</span> with their owner — each <strong>cat</strong> has a different 
                        <span>set of vocalizations</span>, <span>purrs</span> and <span>behaviors</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cats</strong> have up to 100 different vocalizations — dogs only have 10.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cats</strong> find it threatening when you make direct eye contact with them.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cats</strong> mark you as <span>their territory</span> 
                        when they rub their faces and bodies against you, as they have <span>scent glands</span> in those areas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When <strong>cats</strong> hit you with <span>retracted claws</span>, they're <span>playing</span>,
                        not <span>attacking</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When <span>dogs</span> wag their  <span>tails</span>, they may be <span>expressing happiness</span>. 
                        But this isn't the case for <strong>cats</strong>! When your <strong>cat</strong> wags her <span>tail</span>, 
                        it's her way of <span>warning you</span> that you are getting on her last <span>nerve</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li>When your <strong>cat</strong> sticks <span>his butt</span> in <span>your face</span>, he is doing so as <span>a gesture of friendship</span>.</li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Whiskers</span> are also <span>good indicators</span> of a <strong>cat's</strong>  mood. When a <strong>cat</strong> 
                        is <span>scared</span>, he put his 
                        <span>whiskers</span> back. But when a <strong>cat</strong> is in <span>hunting mode</span>, he puts his <span>whiskers</span> forward.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your <strong>cat</strong> drapes its <span>tail</span> over another <strong>cat</strong>,<span>your dog</span>, 
                        or <span>you</span> as <span>a symbol</span> of <span>friendship</span>.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cats</strong> are <span>very fussy</span> about their <span>water bowls</span>; some prefer to ignore their bowls entirely 
                        in favor of drinking from the <span>sink faucet</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cats</strong> love to sleep in laundry baskets, too, because they're basically hiding places with peep holes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cats</strong> often attack your ankles when they're bored.</li>
                    <li>Certain <strong>cats</strong> go crazy for foods you wouldn't expect, like olives, potato chips, and the hops in beer.</li>
                    <li>For some reason, <strong>cats</strong> really dislike citrus scents.</li>
                    <li>
                        If you can't find your <strong>cat</strong>, you should look in a box or a bag,
                        as these are some of their favorite hiding spots!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many <strong>cats</strong> like to lick their owner's freshly washed hair.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some <strong>cats</strong> love the smell of chlorine.</li>

                        A <span>green</span> <strong>cat</strong> was born in Denmark in 1995.
                        Some people believe that high levels of 
                        copper in the water pipes nearby may have 
                        given his fur a verdigris effect.

                        It turns out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>  
                        was a crazy <strong>cat</strong> <span>president</span>! He had four <strong>cats</strong> that

                        and was said to receive more letters than the President himself.

                    <li>A <strong>cat's</strong> <span>learning style</span> is about the same as a <span>2- to 3-year-old child</span>.</li>
                    <li>A group of <span>kittens</span> is called a <span>“kindle”</span>.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cats</strong> have contributed to <span>the extinction</span> of <span>33 different species</span>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cats</strong> were first brought to <span>the Americas in colonial times</span> to get rid of <span>rodents</span>.</li>
                    <li>Each <span>cat's nose</span> print is <span>unique</span>, much like <span>human fingerprints</span>.</li>
                    <li>
                        It's <span>not uncommon</span> to see <strong>cats</strong> in <span>food stores</span> in <span>big cities</span> 
                        as a form of <span>free</span> — and <span>adorable</span> — pest control.</li>

                        <span>Kittens</span> in the same <span>litter</span> can have more than one <span>father</span>. 
                        This is because the female <strong>cat</strong> releases multiple
                        eggs over the course of a <strong>few days</strong> when she is in heat.

                        Some <span>700 million</span> feral <strong>cats</strong> live in the <span>United States</span>, and many 
                        shelters run <span>trap-neuter-release programs</span> to stem the <span>population growth</span>.

                        There are about <span>88 million</span> pet <strong>cats</strong> in the <span>United States</span>, which makes them the
